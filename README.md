Design System Documentation

Nova is the design system for innovation.org, a content-rich website for PhRMA, built by Wunderman DC. It is a series of individual styles, components and guidelines used for creating the content management system and various templates. 

Nova has the modular approach to interface design. There are a number of various components inside the library, which come together in a configured pattern to form pages for different needs. The component based structure makes it flexible, consistent and easy to deploy for our developers. 

Nova adopts atomic design principles, which has been ideated and developed by the designer Brad Frost and is based on nonlinear process organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages.
